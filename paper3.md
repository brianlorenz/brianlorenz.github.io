**Project Description:** A wide variety of galaxy properties can be determined by measuring the strength of emission lines. Typically, astronomers require spectroscopic observations to measure these lines, which need specialized instruments and long observation time. However, I have implemented a novel technique to measure emission lines directly from images, which takes far less observation time. I verify the accuracy of this technique by comparing the new "photometric" measurements to the standard "spectroscopic" measurements.

### 1. Sample Selection

About 700 galaxies in the UNCOVER survey have spectroscopic observations, out of a total of 70,000. Through careful consideration, I have selected 14 galaxies that meet the criteria for this project. The selection process entailed assessing the quality and location of the emission lines for each galaxy. Here, I show the selected targets compared to the full 70,000 galaxies.

### 2. Compare the "Photometric" and "Spectroscopic" Measurements

I then perform the mathematical analysis required to measure both the typical "spectroscopic" emission lines directly, as well as my new technique of "photometric" emission lines measurements. I then compare the two measurements below, and statistically analyze the quality of the comparison.

### 3. Science Results from Emission Line Measurements

One additional upside of measureing emission lines directly from images ("photometric") is that we can make 2D maps of the strongest emission. I generate maps of the measured emission lines, and consider what these imply about the galaxies. This particular emission line follows star formation, so we can see where galaxies were forming stars 10 billions years in the past.

A second emission line can be used to determine the locations of dust in these galaxies, which has been the focus of my thesis. From all of this work, I conclude that these galaxies have clumpy dust and star formation - these galaxies are messy, with no uniform pattern to dust distribution and star formation. These findings have implications for how galaxies grow and evolve into what we see in the universe today, including our own Milky Way Galaxy.
