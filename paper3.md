## Measuring Emission Lines with JWST-MegaScience Medium-Bands: A New Window into Dust and Star Formation at Cosmic Noon

**Project description:** A wide variety of galaxy properties can be determined by measuring the strength of emission lines. Typically, astronomers require spectroscopic observations to measure these lines, which need specialized instruments and long observation time. However, I have implemented a novel technique to measure emission lines directly from images, which takes far less observation time. I verify the accuracy of this technique by comparing the new "photometric" measurements to the standard "spectroscopic" measurements.

### 1. Sample Selection

About 700 galaxies in the UNCOVER survey have spectroscopic observations, out of a total of 70,000. Through careful consideration, I have selected 14 galaxies that meet the criteria for this project. The selection process entailed assessing the quality and location of the emission lines for each galaxy. Here, I show the selected targets compared to the full 70,000 galaxies.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
