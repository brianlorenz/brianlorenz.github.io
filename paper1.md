## An Updated Dust-to-Star Geometry: Dust Attenuation Does Not Depend on Inclination in 1.3 ≤z ≤2.6 Star-forming Galaxies from MOSDEF

**Project description:** One of the main goals of my work is to understand how dust is distriubted in distant galaxies. I hypothesized that we could learn about dust by looking at its effects in edge-on galaxies compared to face-on galaxies; we would expect edge-on galaxies to appear more dusty. Here, I designed an experiment to test that theory.

### 1. Selecting the Galaxies

Unfortuantely, making a dust measurement requires extremely detailed data. Individual galaxies were not sufficient, so I formed groups of galaxies and combined their data. I had to be very careful when forming these groups - galaxy mass and star formation rate (SFR) can affect the dust content, so I wanted to control for these variables. I formed groups of galaxies with similar mass and SFR, but different inclination: edge-on vs face-on. The divisions for the 8 groups are shown below.

### 2. Stacking the Data

Then, I stack the data, making sure to not introduce further bias with the stacking method. Below, we can see strong emission lines pop out of all of the groups, which would not have been easily measurable for individual galaxies.

### 3. Examining our Hypothesis

Below, we plot the newly-made dust measurements along with the mass and SFR of each group. Surprisingly, there is not a change in observed dust content between the edge-on and face-on groups! This is unexpected, and prompted further digging to invesitage why this may be the case.

### 4. Interpretation

After much thought, I realized that in order to for our results to make sense, the dust must have a unique distribution. It cannot be spread evenly throughout the galaxy, since then we would have observed an effect with inclination. Instead, I proposed that the dust exists in spherically symmetric regions near new star formation, as seen below. This new model has been useful to the larger astronomical comminuty as they interpret their own observations of distant galaxies.
